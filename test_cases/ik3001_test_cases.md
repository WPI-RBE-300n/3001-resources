# Inverse Kinematics Test Cases
### Intro:
This is a guide for validating that your team's `robot.ik3001` function is operational. Please note this was tested on my lab code from A24 so **please let me know if any point is considered "out of bounds" by the C25+ built-in error handling**.
### Directions: 
1.  Call `robot.ik3001(generated_position, wrist_alpha)` and record the joint angles that were returned
2. . Run `robot.fk3001([J1 J2 J3 J4])` with the \[1x4] matrix being the output of `robot.ik3001`. Note how close to the original inputted position you are.
3. There are examples of me testing my `robot.ik3001` function from A24 if you are stuck.
### Test Case Table:

| Test Case # | Position (x,y,z)                     | Wrist Angle 1 | Wrist angle 2 |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------- | ------------- |
| 1           | (196.7068,  165.0566,  203.3837)<br> | 10            | -20           |
| 2           | (114.4125, -114.4125, 151.4180)      | 30            | -10           |
| 3           | (281.4007,  0,  224.3253)            | 0             | -15           |
| 4           | (200, 50, 60)                        | 10            | 70            |
| 5           | (126, -105, 19)                      | 30            | 90            |
| 6           | (20, 0, 245)                         | 0             | 15            |

>**Note:** Your team should try to aim for at least under .2 accuracy for each joint
### Examples of Testing `robot.ik3001`:
Example #1:</br>

Example #2: </br>

For those of you who think 0.2 accuracy is way to nit picky, this is from my team's RBE_3001 `robot.ik3001` function back in A24. Note that `home_vector` is just the x, y, z part of the matrix generated by `robot.fk3001`.
